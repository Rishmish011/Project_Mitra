# Project Mitra: Multi-scale Adaptive Network (MAN) Epidemic Modeling
An advanced epidemic modeling platform using multi-scale adaptive networks for public health research and education

> "Mitra" means "friend" in Hindi - a friendly companion for epidemic modeling and public health planning

## About Project Mitra

Project_Mitra is an interactive, open-source epidemic modeling platform that implements the innovative Multi-scale Adaptive Network (MAN) approach to disease simulation. Unlike traditional compartmental or agent-based models, Mitra's adaptive framework bridges multiple scales of human interaction to deliver more realistic and nuanced epidemic projections.

## Key Features

- **Multi-scale Network Architecture**: Simultaneously models household, community, and regional transmission dynamics
- **Adaptive Computational Resolution**: Focuses computational resources on active outbreak areas
- **Behavioral-Pathogen Feedback Loop**: Captures how human behavior changes in response to disease spread
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time visualization of epidemic curves, network structures, and intervention effects
- **Policy Testing Laboratory**: Evaluate the impact of social distancing, mask usage, and vaccination strategies
- **Data Assimilation**: Calibrate models with real-world data for improved forecasting

## Applications

- Educational tool for teaching epidemic dynamics
- Research platform for studying complex contagion patterns
- Decision support for public health planning
- Evaluation framework for intervention strategies
